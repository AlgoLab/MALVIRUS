# Installation and Boot
Clone the git repository at [github.com/AlgoLab/malva\_covid\_service](https://github.com/AlgoLab/malva_covid_service) and execute the <span style="color:black">run-backend.sh</span> script.
The first time you will run the script it will setup the docker image and install the required software in it, note that this first step might might require up to 30 minutes.

After the first setup, booting up the system requires less than a minute.

Once the setup is complete, MALVIRUS will be available [on port 56733](http://localhost:56733) and can be accessed by using an internet browser.
As stated previously, MALVIRUS is logically split into to steps.
We will first show how to create an index and then how to use it to genotype an individual.
